Colony Hackathon Repo

# Introduction
In India farmers face a lot of problems while selling their produce in the market. Due to various intermediaries, they do not get a fair price for their produce, even though there are a lot of government schemes in place. This project aims to decentralize the process to provide better access to information so as to ensure fair price for both producers and retailers. The project primarily uses *ColonyNetwork* and *ColonyJS* to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and further adds functionality as required by the project
